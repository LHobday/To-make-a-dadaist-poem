    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.

      const article = `Last week’s spill rate reached 315 gigalitres a day – it reached 450GL a day day during the March 2021 floods.

Warragamba collected 46mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9am Monday, McDowell said. It may get another 100-200mm “broadly across that area” before the east coast low weakens and moves away from the coast, probably on Tuesday going into Wednesday.

Sydney and surrounds were forecast to have two more days of heavy rain, with falls approaching or exceeding 100mm possible.

Flood evacuation warnings were in place for Wisemans Ferry, Picton’s central business district and parts of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River.

Wollongong to the south of Sydney may collect even more rainfall. Lake Illawarra was another of the areas under an evacuation warning.

It will still be breezy on Wednesday before clear skies return, potentially breaking a run of rainy days for Sydney that began on 21 February.`;
